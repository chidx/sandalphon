#Judgels Sandalphon

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ia-toki/judgels-sandalphon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ia-toki/judgels-sandalphon)

##Description
Sandalphon is an application built using [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) to provide programming resources repository functions and services.

Programming resources consist of programming problems and learning materials. Sandalphon can have clients that use its programming resources. Currently Sandalphon's client is only [Uriel](https://github.com/ia-toki/judgels-uriel) (Competition Gate).

Programming problems and learning materials can be tested by writer on Sandalphon. Writers can share any programming resources that they have access to other writers. Currently writer only given to limited users at the online version.

Sandalphon depends on [Sealtiel](https://github.com/ia-toki/judgels-sealtiel) to send grading request to Gabriel and [Jophiel](https://github.com/ia-toki/judgels-jophiel) for authentication and authorization.
